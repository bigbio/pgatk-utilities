# pgatk utilities library


Pgatk utilities library is a Java API to handle post-translational modifications (PTMs) in proteomics experiments. The library provide a common representation between different PTMs databases such as [UNIMOD](www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/) , [PSI-MOD](http://www.psidev.info/MOD) and the PRIDE Modification Slim Ontology.

It also provide a the corresponding parsers for UNIMOD and PSI-MOD databases. It can be use to retrieve an specific modification using Accessions, Amino Acids, Delta Masses (monoisotopic or average).

How to use pratk-utilities
===============

* How to retrieve all modifications in PSI-Mod and UNIMOD with 'phospho' pattern in the Description:

```java
ModReader modReader = ModReader.getInstance();
List<PTM> ptms = modReader.getPTMListByPatternDescription("Phospho");
assertTrue("Number of PTMs with Term 'Phospho' in name:", ptms.size() == 102);
```
